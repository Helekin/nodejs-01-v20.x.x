## About The Project

This is a comprehensive exercise set covering sections 3 to 9 of the Udemy course, "NodeJS - The Complete Guide (MVC, REST APIs, GraphQL, Deno)" by instructor Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller. The content covers the use of EJS and Express to develop an e-commerce platform, with a database built using .json files, serving as an introduction to the previously mentioned tools.

This iteration might feature alterations compared to the initial course code, including modifications in file names, functions, or variables.

The project was created using the ECMAScript Modules (ESM) system as it aligns with the latest JavaScript programming standards and represents an enhancement over the original code.
