## About The Project

This is a comprehensive exercise set covering sections 10 & 11 of the Udemy course, "NodeJS - The Complete Guide (MVC, REST APIs, GraphQL, Deno)" by instructor by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller. The content encompasses the creation of an e-commerce platform with a MySQL database, styling using Bootstrap, functionality with Express and EJS, and DOM manipulation with JavaScript, aiming to showcase the advanced utilization of these tools.

This iteration might feature alterations compared to the initial course code, including modifications in file names, functions, or variables.

The project was created using the ECMAScript Modules (ESM) system as it aligns with the latest JavaScript programming standards and represents an enhancement over the original code.
